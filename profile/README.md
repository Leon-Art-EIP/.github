Leon'Art is a web and mobile application that connects artists with art enthusiasts and facilitates the buying and selling of art. Unlike other online art marketplaces, Leon'Art is also a social network that promotes the discovery of emerging artists.

## Epitech Innovative Project (EIP)

Leon'Art is our EIP, a large-scale innovative project that we are developing as part of our studies at Epitech, a leading French computer science school. The EIP is a mandatory course for all Epitech students and constitutes a significant part of their education. The EIP starts in the third year and ends in the fifth year of the program.

Our goal is to democratize the buying and selling of art by providing artists with a platform to showcase their work and connect with art enthusiasts, thereby expanding their client base and advancing their careers. The application includes all the necessary elements for selling art, with a communication system and tools to facilitate the acceptance and tracking of artistic commissions.

Leon'Art targets both demand and supply by bringing together art enthusiasts and artists on a single platform. Artists will have an easy-to-use and efficient referencing tool, manage their current orders, and interact directly with art enthusiasts via the social network. Art enthusiasts will have access to a wide range of works, personalized recommendations, and the ability to place orders with emerging artists in their area.

Our long-term goal is to make Leon'Art a leading online art marketplace by enabling artists to make a living from their art and providing art enthusiasts with a platform to discover talented emerging artists.
